Information about compiling and installing

Requires recent versions of bison and flex. I use bison 2.4.3 and flex 2.5.4. It does e.g. not work with bison 1

If you are building from mercurial repository (not from tarball) remember to first run:
autoreconf --install

Note also that the macro AM_MAINTAINER_MODE has been added to configure.ac. If you need to regenerate some of the autotools-generated stuff, you must give configure the option "--enable-maintainer-mode".

See INSTALL for the rest of installation and building procedures. (I would recommend to add "CFLAGS=-O4" for normal non-debugging usage.)
